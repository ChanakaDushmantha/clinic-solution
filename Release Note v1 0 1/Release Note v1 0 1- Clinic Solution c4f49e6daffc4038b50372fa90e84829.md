# Release Note v1.0.1- Clinic Solution

[Release Date: 2023/10/21]

## **Overview**

Version 1.0.1 of Clinic Solution brings two valuable new features to our clinic management system, designed to enhance efficiency and patient safety. These features enable doctors to quickly access frequently used prescriptions and stay on top of pharmaceutical expiration dates, thereby improving overall clinic operations.

## **New Features**

### **1. Favorite Prescription List**

Doctors can now create and maintain a favorite prescription list. This feature streamlines the prescription process, allowing physicians to quickly access and apply frequently used prescriptions. With just a few clicks, doctors can save time and provide accurate treatment recommendations.

### **2. Pharmaceutical Expiry Date Tracking**

We've introduced a pharmaceutical expiry date tracking feature, designed to help clinics manage their medication inventory more effectively. This feature enables users to:

- Easily identify expired pharmaceuticals: The system will automatically detect expired pharmaceuticals in your inventory. Notify how many pharmaceuticals have already expired, ensuring timely removal.
- Monitor upcoming expirations: Keep records about pharmaceuticals that are about to expire, allowing for better inventory management and reducing the risk of administering expired medications.

## **How to Use the New Features**

- To use the "Favorite Prescription List," navigate to the prescription section in the application. You can add frequently used prescriptions to your favorites and access them quickly when writing new prescriptions.
